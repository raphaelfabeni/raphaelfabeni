### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Fabeni here!

Hi! My name is Raphael Fabeni, and I'm a ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· developer who tries to have healthy lifestyle. 

Currently, I'm working full time at [Red Ventures](https://www.redventures.com/) and living in  ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Charlotte, North Carolina. I believe that more than writing code, planning solutions to help people is what makes our work so nice. 

Feel free to ask me anything; the best and easier way is to send me a [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/raphaelfabeni). I also try to write about some random stuff on my [blog](https://raphaelfabeni.com/blog/).

âš¡ Fun facts: 

* more than 10 tattoos
* mohawk
* big fan of Andrea Bocelli and Luciano Pavarotti 
* training for triathlon
